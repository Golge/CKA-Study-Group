### Kubernetes Challenge: Design and Install a Kubernetes Cluster

Let's set up a Kubernetes Cluster with a highly available Control Plane. Please describe the necessary steps and requirements in detail. After completing the setup, run the 'kubectl get node' command and share the results. If needed, you can use virtual machines on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
​
#### Here are some notes for your reference
1. **Cluster Configuration**
   - Set up a Kubernetes cluster with 3 control plane nodes.
   - The number of worker nodes is flexible(You can use one worker node) and can be increased as needed.
​
2. **Choose a Container Network Interface (CNI)**
   - Select a Container Network Interface (CNI) that suits your requirements and preferences.
​
3. **Practice Environment**
   - Work on a dedicated virtual machine or server. (You can use KodeKloud Playground)
   - Simulate a real production cluster where you intend to deploy your team's applications.
​
4. **Kubernetes Version**
   - Use Kubernetes version v1.28 to align with the current CKA exam requirements.
